About Me
===========================

[I][] started this blog in [September 2007][start] shortly after I began my
current [post-doctoral][] appointment. I wanted an outlet 
for research-related writing that lies somewhere between my notebooks and 
[published papers][pubs]. 

That means you will find [expositions][jensen], [book reviews][sc], 
[commentary][] on conferences, [lists][], and the odd bit of 
[self-promotion][idr].

Colophon
--------
The posts in the blog are written in a hybrid of [Markdown][] (for text) and
[LaTeX][] (for equations) and converted into HTML by [MaRuKu][] as part of 
the [Jekyll][] engine. 

[My entire site](/) is managed this way and there are more details about the 
design and technology I use at the main site's [colophon][].
