I've had good experiences with related sites such as [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com) and particularly [MathOverflow](http://mathoverflow.com). So far I've only had a chance to sign up and quickly look around MetaOptimize but from what I've seen the users seem sharp, the questions on-topic, and the answers informative.

This is a great addition to the burgeoning online machine learning community and [Joseph Turian](http://www-etud.iro.umontreal.ca/~turian/) ([@turian](http://twitter.com/turian)) has done a great job at setting the tone of the site as well as encouraging a number of solid researchers and practitioners to join before publicising it too widely. 

I'm really looking forward to participating more once I'm back from holidays.
